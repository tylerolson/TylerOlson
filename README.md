## Hi, I'm Tyler.

I'm a Computer Science & Engineering student at the University of Nevada, Reno, and I enjoy building backend systems and developer tools. My goal is to work at a nonprofit, either in environmental, healthcare, or transportation, working towards a more ethical and sustainable future.
